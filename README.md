# Machine_Learning_Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview

The purpose of this challenge was to apply machine learning to solve a real-world problem, credit risk. Because the number of good loans is so unbalanced compared to the number of bad loans, it is a challenge dealing with an unbalanced dataset. The dataset contained a lot of features to help build a model that can hopefully predict high-risk accounts more easily. In this challenge, I went through 6 different models/techniques of supervised machine learning in order to arrive at a conclusion.




## Results

The results for the 6 tests were varied as I went through each one. To describe the results further:

- Naive Random Oversampling:

- SMOTE Oversample:

- Undersampling Cluster Centroids:

- Combination Over/Under SMOTEEN:

- Balanced Random Forest Classifier:

- Easy Ensemble Adaboost Classifier:



## Summary

It was very interesting to use the different models with the dataset and see the results. If I had to choose a model as the best choice, I would go with the balanced random forest model as it had the best precision and recall for true positives. SMOTE would be the 2nd choice but to be honest, I would probably need to do a lot more tuning or try other models to make a better informed choice.
